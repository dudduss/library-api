This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

If you would like to run the app, please contact me for DB details so that API requests can be sent and data can be viewed.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Use http://localhost:3000/api/books routes to modify the library

Here's a [demo of the API](https://www.loom.com/share/ce74ad0088614e568505ade0a0f2bd89) to see how it works in action!
